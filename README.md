## Real-Time Facial Emotion Detection
A Python-based application that detects emotions from live webcam footage using OpenCV and DeepFace.
This project performs real-time facial emotion detection using a webcam. It leverages OpenCV for video capture and DeepFace for emotion analysis, displaying the dominant emotion (e.g., happy, sad) directly on the video feed with a bounding box and label.
